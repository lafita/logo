# Description

The peptide bond links amino acids together to generate proteins, the working units of biology. 
Likewise, the *BioJava Project* brings together a large community of programmers to provide software solutions for bioinformatics.

The logo is designed with a flat ball and stick representation of the peptide bond as a negative space figure in a green background. Balls are colored by their atom type (black Carbon, red Oxygen, blue Nitrogen and white Hydrogen). The font type is lowercase *Comfortaa*.
