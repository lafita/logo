# Description

The peptide bond links amino acids together to generate proteins, the working units of biology. 
Likewise, the *BioJava Project* brings together a large community of programmers to provide software solutions for bioinformatics.

The logo is designed with a flat ball and stick representation of the peptide bond as a negative space figure in a green background. Balls are colored by their atom type (black Carbon, red Oxygen, blue Nitrogen and white Hydrogen). 
The words Bio and Java are separated into the upper-left and lower-right corners of the logo, in the spaces left by the peptide bond, with the font type *Comfortaa*.
